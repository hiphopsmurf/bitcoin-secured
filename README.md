Offline transaction signing for Bitcoin in HTML5 and JavaScript

This software is still alpha-quality software. Although it has been used successfully to make transactions on the blockchain, please do not risk any more btc you wouldn't want to lose at this point.  In the next few days, changes to the UI will be made and further testing will be done at which point a beta version will be released.

This implementation of a HTML5/JS offline signing app was proposed by xDan here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=167312.0

This project uses significant public domain code from https://github.com/brainwallet/brainwallet.github.com as well as well as BitcoinJS, so a big thank you to those two projects for leading the way in Bitcoin in JavaScript.
